# Release Workflow

## Phase 1: Release-Please Gate

Check for active release-please PRs:

```bash
gh pr list --label "autorelease: pending" --json number,title,url --limit 5
```

- If PRs found: display them to the user via `AskUserQuestion` with options to review, merge, or skip
- If no PRs (empty array): continue to Phase 2

## Phase 2: Run Analysis

Run the release analyzer:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/commitcraft-release-analyze.sh
```

Parse output between `RELEASE_ANALYZE_START` and `RELEASE_ANALYZE_END`.

Extract these key-value pairs:
- `CURRENT_VERSION` — latest prod tag
- `NEW_VERSION` — proposed next version
- `BUMP_TYPE` — major/minor/patch/none/initial
- `COMMIT_COUNT` — number of unreleased commits

Parse commits between `COMMITS_START` and `COMMITS_END`:
- Each line: `<short-hash><unit-separator><subject>`
- The unit separator is ASCII `\x1f` (invisible character between hash and subject)
- Parse conventional commit type from subject: `type(scope): description (#PR)`
- Extract: type, scope (optional), description, PR number (optional)

### If BUMP_TYPE is "none"

Inform the user:
```
Stage and prod are in sync at <CURRENT_VERSION>.
No unreleased commits found.
```
Stop here.

### If script exits with error

Display the error output to the user (not on main, dirty tree, gh not authenticated, etc.) and stop.

## Phase 3: Generate Release Notes

Group parsed commits by type into sections. Order matters:

| Commit Type | Section Name | Show by Default |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `feat` | Features | yes |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes | yes |
| `perf` | Performance | yes |
| `revert` | Reverts | yes |
| `docs` | Documentation | yes |
| `chore` | Other Changes | no |
| `refactor` | Other Changes | no |
| `test` | Other Changes | no |
| `build` | Other Changes | no |
| `ci` | Other Changes | no |
| `style` | Other Changes | no |

**Rules:**
- Only show "Other Changes" section if there are NO visible sections (all commits are hidden types)
- Omit empty sections entirely
- If a commit type has `!` (e.g., `feat!:`), it's still categorized by its base type but noted as breaking

**Format each entry as:**
```
- <scope>: <description> (#<PR>) (<hash>)
```
- If no scope: `- <description> (#<PR>) (<hash>)`
- If no PR number: `- <scope>: <description> (<hash>)`
- If neither: `- <description> (<hash>)`

## Phase 4: Present to User

Use `AskUserQuestion` to present the release summary:

```
## Release Summary

**<CURRENT_VERSION>** → **<NEW_VERSION>** (<BUMP_TYPE> bump)
**Commits:** <COMMIT_COUNT> on stage, not yet in prod

### Release Notes

<generated notes from Phase 3>
```

Options:
1. **Create release** — tag and create GitHub release with these notes
2. **Change version** — override the suggested version
3. **Edit notes** — modify release notes before creating
4. **Cancel** — abort release

### If user chooses "Change version"
Ask for the desired version. Validate it matches `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.
Return to Phase 4 with the updated version.

### If user chooses "Edit notes"
Ask the user what changes they want to the release notes.
Apply changes and return to Phase 4 with updated notes.

## Phase 5: Create Release

After user approves, run pre-flight checks:

```bash
git fetch --tags
```

```bash
git tag -l <NEW_VERSION>
```

If the tag already exists, inform the user and ask how to proceed (abort or choose different version).

Create and push the tag:

```bash
git tag <NEW_VERSION>
git push origin <NEW_VERSION>
```

Create the GitHub release:

```bash
gh release create <NEW_VERSION> --title "<NEW_VERSION>" --notes "<release_notes>"
```

**If `gh release create` fails** after the tag was already pushed:
- Inform the user the tag `<NEW_VERSION>` exists on the remote
- Provide the manual retry command: `gh release create <NEW_VERSION> --notes "..."`
- Do NOT attempt to delete the pushed tag

**On success**, display:
```
Release <NEW_VERSION> created.
GitHub release: <URL from gh output>

To deploy to prod: trigger the deploy workflow from this tag.
```
